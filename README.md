# Recommender-systems
Predict a movie genre based on movie description.
# Description
### Mission objective:

For this challenge, explored are different NLP methods:  
* Fine-tune a transformer model (BERT) to classify movies according to their genre based on their plot.
* Use spacy to implement one extra feature, for example key-word extraction, sentiment analysis, or text summarization. 
## The data:
* [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). A subset of this data can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset).

# Usage

* Explanation how to preprocess data.

* Explanation what are the main steps to fine-tune a transformer model and how they work (i.e. encoding, picking an optmizer and loss function).

* Appropiate metrics to evaluate the results of approach.
